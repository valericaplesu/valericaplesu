### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**valericaplesu/valericaplesu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

My name is Vali and I'm passionate about android, kotlin, ai, iot, ar, cooking, learning new tech things and... people :) 

âš¡ Fun fact: I do love coffee, but I hate those mornings when I wake up and there is no milk in the fridge. So, I've develop my own google action to remember me to buy milk ðŸ˜„ more about that [here](https://dev.to/valericaplesu/developing-for-the-future-32pc).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about leadership, confidence, being aware of feedback and how to bypass the "I'm a developer, just let me code!" etc.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any tech issue around
